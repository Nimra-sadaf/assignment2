        <li> 1 tsp instant yeast</li>  
        <li> 1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>   
        <li>200ml warm water</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt together.
            Make a well in the center and add the yeast, olive oil, and warm water. Mix until combined.
            Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
            Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.
            Prepare the Pizza:
            
            Preheat your oven to its highest setting (usually around 250°C / 480°F).
            Punch down the dough and divide it into two portions. Roll out each portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
            Place the dough on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
            Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
            Add your toppings of choice, such as mozzarella cheese and fresh basil leaves.
            Bake the Pizza:
            
            Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
            Remove from the oven, let it cool slightly, slice, and serve hot.</li>
